# pythonForSongs
A python script to open my favourite music web app. 


#!/usr/bin/env python
import webbrowser
webbrowser.open('https://www.gaana.com')

How to:
1. Do "vim gaana.command", type in the code. The first line tells the kernel that its a python script. 
2. Save the file with ".command" extension.
3. "Chmod +x" on terminal to give it executable rights. 
4. chenge the script's logo and hide the extension.(https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2012/03/how-to-customise-any-folder-or-app-icon-using-any-image-in-os-x/)

Double click the app and impress friends! Peace!! xoxoxox
